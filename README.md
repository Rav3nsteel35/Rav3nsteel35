## üöß Project description

‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®Obligatory sudoku Solver project that we are all seemingly morally and legally required to have here on github‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

### Stuff I actually care about: 


**üó®Ô∏è Online Chat App**  
`‚Üí` A web-based chatroom app supporting 10+ users yelling into the void at once.  
Built both the front-end *and* back-end. Still waiting for someone to say hi.

**üéÆ AI Learns to Play Flappy Bird**  
`‚Üí` Used neuroevolution to train a bird-brained AI to dodge pipes better than me.  
Game and AI coded from scratch. Surprisingly emotional journey.

**üß† AI Korean Language Learning Aid** (WIP)
`‚Üí` An anime-themed chatbot app that gamifies Korean learning with AI-driven conversations, outfits, and questionable life choices.  
Educational? Yes. Weirdly charming? Also yes. (Currently in development) 

**üìä AI School Performance Predictor**  
`‚Üí` Used TensorFlow to predict student grades based on real datasets.  
Machine learned. GPA cried.

**üç≥ 2D Cooking Dungeon Game (WIP)**  
`‚Üí` A Godot-powered cooking game where you battle AI enemies, explore dungeons, and try not to burn the soup.  
Currently in development, like my coping mechanisms.
