<h1>Hi, I'm Merv! <br/><a href="https://github.com/Rav3nsteel35">I love having computers run my code for me because I'm not very athletic </a></h1>

I'm Mervyn, a computer science student at the University of Rochester!

<h2>About me:</h2>

ðŸ“š I aim to explore the intersection between AI and natural languages 
I cured my gaming addiction by substituting it with a leet code addiction!

ðŸŽ¯ Goals: I've been trying to combine AI and natural languages to enhance the language learning process (specifically east asian languages) using chatbots and gamification 

ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I've read well over a thousand books. (japanese manga)
